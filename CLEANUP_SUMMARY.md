# Code Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mock Data Objects and Mock API Functions
- **Removed `wardrobeAPIMock`** from `/src/features/virtual-wardrobe/api.js`
  - Deleted entire mock API object with fake data for wardrobe items
  - Kept only the real Supabase API export

- **Removed mock authentication** from `/src/features/auth/api.js`
  - Replaced mock login/register functions with actual API calls
  - Removed hardcoded test credentials and fake tokens

- **Removed mock weather data** from `/src/features/outfit-analysis/services/weatherService.js`
  - Replaced mock weather responses with proper error throwing
  - Removed fallback mock data for forecast

### 2. Removed All Console Statements
Successfully removed all `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` statements from:
- Authentication context
- Home screen
- Outfit analysis components and hooks
- Virtual wardrobe components and hooks
- Profile screen
- Weather service
- API clients
- Storage service

### 3. Behavior Changes
- **Weather Service**: Now throws errors instead of returning mock data when API key is not configured
- **Auth API**: Now makes real API calls instead of returning mock responses
- **Error Handling**: Removed console logging in catch blocks - errors are now properly thrown or silently handled

## Files Modified
Total of 19 JavaScript files were cleaned:
- All mock data objects removed
- All console statements removed (0 remaining)
- No mock references remaining (except for testing-related mocks)

## Important Notes
- The application now requires proper backend configuration to function
- Weather service requires valid OpenWeatherMap API key
- Authentication requires backend API to be running
- No fallback mock data will be provided if services are unavailable
